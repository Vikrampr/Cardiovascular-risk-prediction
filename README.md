# Cardiovascular-risk-prediction

# Introduction: 
Heart disease is one the major cause of moribity and mortality globally. A heart attack happens when the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a section of heart muscle suddenly becomes blocked and the heart can’t get oxygen. If blood flow isn’t restored quickly, the section of heart muscle begins to die.

Doctors and Scientists across the globe have started to look into Machine Learning Techniques to develop screening tools.

# Objective:
In this project, we shall be giving you a walk through on the development of a screening tool for predicting whether a patient has a 10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) based on their present health conditions using different Machine Learning Techniques.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Heart disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, killing more people each year than any other cause. In this project, we shall be giving you a walk through on the development of a screening tool for predicting whether a patient has a 10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) using different Machine Learning techniques. The given dataset provides the patients’ information. It includes over 3,390 records and 17 attributes. Each attribute is a potential risk factor. There are both demographic, behavioural, and medical risk factors given for the analysis.

# PROJECT WORKFLOW:
Data Cleaning

Checking for Duplicates – None found

Handling NaN values – 510 NaN values which is 0.01% of the entire dataset

Outlier Treatment

Feature Engineering

Binary Encoding / One-Hot Encoding

Deriving of a new feature i.e., avgBP (replacing diaBP & sysBP)

EDA – Feature Analysis

Heat Map

EDA on Features

Handling Imbalance Data

Model Training, Testing & Hyper-Parameter Tuning

Performance Comparison

Data Cleaning:

Handling NaN Values:
KNN Imputer – For continuous Simple Imputer – For categorical
Outlier Treatment:
totChol has values > 600 Replacing that with 500

Feature Engineering:

Binary Encoding / One-Hot Encoding:
sex & is_smoking has (Male/Female) and (Yes/No) data respectively. Since only two features are to be treated, we simply did binary encoding to represent (Male = 1, Female = 0) & (Yes = 1 & No = 0)
New Feature – avgBP We have diaBP & sysBP in our dataset, which represents diastolic and systolic BP. For a healthy person BP measure is 120/80. Both these are co-related with each other (78%). avgBP = (sysBP+diaBP)/2

EDA:

EDA on Features – Age & Smoking: Risk is High in age group of (42 to 45),(56 to 58) and age above 62 despite they are smoking or not.
EDA on Features – CigsperDay, Sex & Risk: There is no Exact Inference to say that - less the cigarettes consumption means less heart disease and vice versa. But Male, more than Female are in the high risk of Heart disease, since the proportion of male smokers v/s female are high and on a reality smokers will be having high risk of getting heart disease.
EDA on Features – Diabetic, Sex & Risk: Non Diabetic – Less risk of heart disease. Diabetic – High risk of heart disease

Handling Imbalance Data:

Common Methods to Handle Imbalance Data:
Under sampling the majority class
Over sampling the minority class
SMOTE Synthetic Minority Over Sampling Technique Reduces overfitting during oversampling Synthetic Sampling is used.

Evaluation Metrics:

1. Recall
2. F1 Score
3. ROC Curve

DATA MODELLING AND TRAINING:

We shall study the following training models:
Logistic Regression
K Nearest Neighbour
Decision Tree
SVM
